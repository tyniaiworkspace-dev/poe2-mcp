Stun is a core combat mechanic in PoE2 that interrupts enemy actions. There are two types:

2. All 'More' modifiers multiply separately
   - Example: 30% more × 25% more × 20% more

Final Damage = Base × (1 + ΣIncreased) × Π(1 + More)

Why More is better:
- 100% increased damage = 2x multiplier
- 50% more damage = 1.5x multiplier
- But if you already have 200% increased, adding 100% more increased = 3.0x → 4.0x (33% gain)
