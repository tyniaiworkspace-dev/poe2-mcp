Poison is a damaging ailment that deals Chaos damage over time. In PoE2, poison has a
DEFAULT STACK LIMIT OF 1 - this is a MAJOR change from PoE1 where poison could stack
infinitely.

Multiple poison instances CAN exist on a target, each with their own duration, but only
the highest damage instance(s) will actually deal damage, up to your stack limit.

To make poison builds work in PoE2, you need sources that increase your poison stack
limit, such as the Escalating Poison Support gem.

1. You deal physical and/or chaos damage with a hit that has poison chance
2. If poison is applied, it deals 20% of the hit's combined physical + chaos damage per second
3. Base poison duration is 2 seconds
4. DEFAULT STACK LIMIT: 1 - only the strongest poison deals damage
5. Multiple poisons can exist but only up to your stack limit actually deal damage
6. Poison damage BYPASSES Energy Shield (damages life directly)

- You hit for 1000 physical + 500 chaos = 1500 total
- Poison DPS = 0.20 x 1500 = 300 chaos DPS
- Over 2 seconds = 600 total chaos damage
- If you apply 5 poisons, only the STRONGEST ONE deals damage

Example (with Escalating Poison - stack limit 2):
- Same hit, but now 2 poisons deal damage

            detailed_explanation="""
This is THE most important damage scaling concept in Path of Exile.

- "Increased" modifiers are ADDITIVE with each other
- "More" modifiers are MULTIPLICATIVE with everything

Understanding this is crucial for optimizing damage.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. All "Increased" modifiers add together first
   - 50% + 30% + 20% increased = 100% increased = 2.0x multiplier

2. All "More" modifiers multiply separately
   - 30% more x 20% more = 1.3 x 1.2 = 1.56x multiplier

3. Order of operations:
   Base Damage x (1 + Sum of Increased) x (More 1) x (More 2) x ...

The KEY insight: If you already have lots of "increased" damage,
adding more "increased" has diminishing returns. "More" multipliers
always give their full multiplicative benefit.
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Final Damage = Base x (1 + TotalIncreased%) x More1 x More2 x More3...

Example:
- Base: 100 damage
- Increased: 50% + 30% + 20% = 100% increased
- More: 30% more, 20% more
- Calculation: 100 x 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.2 = 312 damage

Why More is powerful:
- If you have 200% increased, adding 100% more = 3.0x -> 4.0x (33% gain)
- Adding 50% more instead = 3.0x x 1.5 = 4.5x (50% gain!)

            detailed_explanation="""
Life Leech allows you to recover life based on the damage you deal. When you hit
an enemy with an attack that has leech, a portion of the damage dealt is recovered
as life over time.

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS (PoE2 DIFFERS FROM PoE1):
- Leech RATE: How much damage is converted to leech (e.g., 5% of physical damage)
- Leech INSTANCE: Each hit creates a leech instance that heals over 1 SECOND (base)
- NO LEECH CAP: PoE2 has NO maximum leech per second (unlike PoE1's 20% cap)
- MONSTER LEECH RESISTANCE: Scales with monster level, reduces leech effectiveness
- OVERLEECH: Ability for leech to continue past full life (requires specific sources)

By default, leech stops when you reach full life. Overleech (from items like
Couture of Crimson, Life Leech III gem, or passives like Fast Metabolism) allows
leech instances to continue healing even at full life, creating a buffer.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. You deal damage with a hit that has life leech
2. Base leech = Damage × Leech Rate (e.g., 2000 damage × 5% = 100 life)
3. Monster Leech Resistance reduces this: Effective = Base × (1 - Monster_Leech_Res%)
4. A leech instance is created that recovers the full amount over 1 SECOND (base)
5. NO CAP on total leech - unlimited instances can stack
6. Leech stops at full life UNLESS you have Overleech
7. With Overleech, instances continue past full life (healing buffer)
""",

Leech Per Hit = Damage_Dealt × Leech_Rate% × (1 - Monster_Leech_Resistance%)

Recovery Duration = 1 second (base, modifiable by 'leech faster/slower')
Recovery Per Second = Leech_Amount / Recovery_Duration

Example:
- 5% physical leech, 2000 damage hit, monster has 30% leech resistance
- Base leech = 2000 × 0.05 = 100 life
- Effective leech = 100 × (1 - 0.30) = 70 life
- Recovery = 70 life over 1 second = 70 life/sec per instance

Multiple hits = multiple instances = multiplicative recovery (no cap!)
- 10 hits/second × 70 life/instance = 700 life/sec total

Modifiers:
- 'Leech X% faster' = shorter recovery duration (more life/sec)
- 'Leech X% slower' = longer recovery duration (less life/sec, but longer overleech)

- Can be increased through passives and items
- Additional curses beyond limit replace the oldest curse

CURSE TYPES:
- Hex Curses: Standard curses, applied and last until duration expires
- Mark Curses: Single-target curses with special mechanics (see 'marks')

Ward is a NEW defensive mechanic in PoE2 that provides a unique form of damage
absorption. Unlike Energy Shield, Ward completely absorbs incoming damage until
it's depleted, then enters a restoration period.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Absorbs ALL damage types (including chaos)
- Does not split damage like ES (fully absorbs or breaks)
- Restores fully after a delay when not taking damage
- Cannot be leeched or regenerated
- Does not recharge partially - it's all or nothing

Ward is particularly effective against many small hits but can be overwhelmed
by large single hits that exceed your Ward amount.

1. Ward absorbs incoming damage completely
2. If hit damage < Ward: Ward absorbs hit, Ward reduced by hit amount
3. If hit damage > Ward: Ward breaks, remaining damage goes to ES/Life
4. When Ward reaches 0, it enters "broken" state
5. After X seconds of not taking damage, Ward restores to FULL
6. Restoration is all-or-nothing (no partial restore)

DAMAGE ABSORPTION:
- Ward absorbs before Energy Shield and Life
- Works against ALL damage types including chaos
- Each hit is processed separately
- Ward cannot go negative

RESTORATION:
- Default restoration delay: ~5 seconds
- Must take NO damage during delay
- Restores to maximum Ward instantly
- Some sources modify restoration delay
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Damage Flow:
1. Incoming Hit Damage
2. Ward absorbs (if Ward > 0)
3. If Ward >= Damage: Ward -= Damage, you take 0
4. If Ward < Damage: Ward = 0 (broken), overflow to ES/Life

Example (100 Ward):
- 50 damage hit: Ward absorbs fully, Ward = 50 remaining
- 30 damage hit: Ward absorbs fully, Ward = 20 remaining
- 40 damage hit: Ward breaks (40 > 20), 20 damage to ES/Life

Restoration:
- After 5 seconds of no damage: Ward = Maximum Ward
- Damage resets the timer
- Must avoid ALL damage during restore period

Effective HP:
- Ward + ES + Life (but Ward must fully absorb each hit)

Flasks are a core survival and utility mechanic in Path of Exile 2. Unlike PoE1, flask
management in PoE2 is more deliberate with a redesigned charge system and clear
distinctions between flask types.

FLASK TYPES:
1. Life Flasks: Restore life over time or instantly
2. Mana Flasks: Restore mana over time or instantly
3. Utility Flasks: Grant temporary buffs (speed, resistances, etc.)

CHARGE SYSTEM:
- Flasks have maximum charges (varies by flask)
- Each use consumes a portion of charges
- Charges are gained by killing enemies or hitting enemies
- Some flasks gain charges on hit, others on kill
- Charges decay while not in combat (unlike PoE1)

INSTILLING ORBS:
- Currency that adds automatic trigger conditions to flasks
- Examples: "Use when hit", "Use when mana is low", "Use at start of flask effect"
- Only ONE instilling mod can be on a flask at a time
- Great for quality-of-life or complex flask management
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Flasks start empty or partially filled
2. Kill or hit enemies to gain charges
3. Press flask key to consume charges and gain effect
4. Effect duration varies by flask type and quality
5. Cannot use flask if insufficient charges
6. Some flasks have cooldowns between uses

LIFE/MANA FLASKS:
- Life Recovery: Heals over 2 seconds (base) or instant
- Mana Recovery: Restores mana over 2 seconds (base) or instant
- "Instant" prefix makes recovery happen immediately
- Recovery can be cancelled by using another flask of same type

UTILITY FLASKS:
- Duration-based effects (typically 4-5 seconds)
- Effects include: movement speed, resistances, damage, defenses
- Can have multiple utility flasks active simultaneously
- Quality increases effect duration

CHARGE GAIN:
- On Kill: Most reliable, varies by flask (3-5 charges typical)
- On Hit: Less common, good for boss fights
- Some passives and items grant "flask charges gained"

        # TRIGGER MECHANICS
        # =====================================================================

            category=MechanicCategory.INTERACTION,
            short_description="Skills that activate automatically when conditions are met",
            detailed_explanation="""
Triggered skills are abilities that cast automatically when certain conditions are met,
without requiring manual activation. This is a powerful mechanic that allows builds
to gain extra actions without additional button presses.

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Trigger vs Cast: Triggered skills are NOT "cast" - they're triggered
- Cooldown Sharing: Many triggers share cooldowns with similar triggers
- Mana Cost: Triggered skills often have modified or zero mana costs
- Animation: Most triggers don't interrupt your current action

TRIGGER TYPES:
1. On Hit triggers: Activate when you hit an enemy
2. On Kill triggers: Activate when you kill an enemy
3. On Damage Taken triggers: Activate when you take damage (CWDT equivalent)
4. Conditional triggers: Activate when specific conditions are met

TRIGGER SOURCES:
- Support gems (e.g., Cast when Damage Taken)
- Item mods ("Trigger socketed spell when you use a skill")
- Passive tree nodes
- Unique item effects
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Trigger condition is checked continuously
2. When condition is met, skill attempts to trigger
3. If not on cooldown and requirements met, skill triggers
4. Cooldown starts (if applicable)
5. Triggered skill executes automatically

COOLDOWN MECHANICS:
- Most triggers have cooldowns (0.25-8 seconds typical)
- Some triggers share cooldowns with similar triggers
- Cooldown recovery speed affects trigger cooldowns
- Multiple instances of same trigger don't bypass cooldown

MANA/COST RULES:
- Many triggered skills cost NO mana
- Some triggers have reduced cost (e.g., 50% less)
- Spirit-reserving skills generally cannot be triggered
- Check specific trigger for cost rules

"TRIGGER" VS "CAST":
- Triggered skills bypass "when you cast" conditions
- Triggered skills don't count as "casting" for bonuses
- Critical: Affects interactions with many passives/items
- Example: "10% more damage when you cast" doesn't apply to triggers
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Trigger Cooldown = Base Cooldown / (1 + % increased cooldown recovery speed)

Example (Cast when Damage Taken):
- Base cooldown: 0.25 seconds
- Activates when you take X damage (scales with gem level)
- Triggered spell level is LIMITED by gem level
- Lower level CWDT = more frequent triggers but weaker spells

Trigger Interaction:
- Trigger A procs → Cooldown A starts
- Trigger B with shared cooldown → Also on cooldown
- Independent triggers → Separate cooldowns

Mana Cost (varies by trigger):
- CWDT: Zero mana cost for triggered skill
- Item triggers: Often 50-100% of normal cost
- Some triggers: Full mana cost

Knockback is a crowd control effect that physically displaces enemies, pushing them
away from the knockback source. This can be used defensively to create space or
offensively to push enemies into terrain or other hazards.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Chance-based: Most sources have % chance to knockback
- Distance-based: Knockback pushes enemies a fixed distance
- Directional: Knockback direction depends on source
- Terrain interaction: Enemies can be pushed into walls/obstacles

KNOCKBACK SOURCES:
- Skills with inherent knockback (Heavy Strike, etc.)
- Support gems (Knockback Support)
- Item mods ("% chance to Knockback on hit")

DEFENSIVE USES:
- Create distance from melee enemies
- Interrupt enemy attacks
- Push enemies into environmental hazards
- Control enemy positioning in fights
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Hit enemy with knockback chance
2. Roll against knockback chance
3. If successful, enemy is pushed in knockback direction
4. Enemy moves knockback distance (unless blocked by terrain)
5. Knockback can interrupt some enemy actions

KNOCKBACK DIRECTION:
- Melee attacks: Usually AWAY from you
- Projectiles: In direction of projectile travel
- Area skills: Away from skill center
- Some skills have specific knockback directions

DISTANCE:
- Base knockback distance varies by source
- Typically 2-4 units
- Increased knockback distance modifiers exist
- Enemies stop at terrain/walls

INTERACTION WITH TERRAIN:
- Enemies pushed into walls stop there
- Can push enemies off ledges (situational)
- Some arenas have hazardous terrain to exploit
- Walls don't deal extra damage on impact

STUN RELATIONSHIP:
- Knockback can occur independently of stun
- Some skills combine both effects
- Heavy hits more likely to both stun AND knockback
- Knockback can interrupt non-stunnable enemies (sometimes)

Blind is a debuff that significantly reduces an enemy's ability to hit you. When an
enemy is blinded, their accuracy is heavily reduced, causing them to miss attacks
more frequently.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Reduces enemy ACCURACY (not your evasion)
- Duration-based debuff
- Has diminishing returns on bosses
- Some enemies are immune to blind

BLIND EFFECT:
- Blinded enemies have greatly reduced accuracy
- This makes evasion builds even more effective
- Works against ALL attacks (not just melee)
- Does not affect spells that don't use accuracy

BLIND SOURCES:
- Skills (Smoke Mine, etc.)
- Support gems
- Item mods ("Blind nearby enemies")
- Passive tree nodes
- Ascendancy bonuses

5. Effect ends when duration expires

ACCURACY REDUCTION:
- Blind typically reduces accuracy by 20-50%
- Exact value depends on source
- Less effective against high-accuracy enemies
- Stacks with your evasion for double defense

DURATION:
- Base duration varies by source (typically 4-5 seconds)
- Can be extended with duration modifiers
- Refreshes on reapplication

BOSS INTERACTION:
- Many bosses have reduced blind effectiveness
- Some pinnacle bosses are immune
- Check specific boss mechanics

            detailed_explanation="""
Culling Strike is a powerful mechanic that instantly kills enemies when they fall
below a certain life threshold (usually 10%). This effectively means you need to
deal 90% of an enemy's HP instead of 100%.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Instant kill at threshold (default 10% life)
- Works on ALL enemies including bosses
- Triggers on HIT only
- Does not work with damage over time

HOW IT'S CALCULATED:
- Enemy life checked AFTER your hit damage
- If enemy life <= threshold after damage: instant death
- Does NOT require the hit to bring them below threshold
- Any hit that connects can trigger culling

CULLING STRIKE SOURCES:
- Culling Strike Support gem
- Item mods ("Culling Strike" or "Enemies killed at X% life")
- Passive tree nodes
- Some unique items
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. You hit an enemy with a skill that has Culling Strike
2. Your hit deals damage normally
3. After damage, check enemy life percentage
4. If enemy life <= culling threshold: INSTANT KILL
5. No damage dealt beyond killing blow - enemy just dies

THRESHOLD VALUES:
- Standard Culling Strike: 10% life
- Enhanced versions: May have higher thresholds (15%, 20%)
- Some sources: "Culling Strike against enemies at X% threshold"

BOSS INTERACTION:
- Culling Strike WORKS on bosses
- This is effectively 10% MORE damage against all enemies
- Huge for boss fights with massive HP pools
- Some pinnacle bosses may have culling immunity (rare)

DOT INTERACTION:
- DoT damage CANNOT trigger culling strike
- Only HITS can cull enemies
- If enemy is at 5% life with your DoT, they don't die to cull
- You must hit them for cull to trigger

OVERKILL:
- Culling provides no "overkill" damage
- Enemy simply dies at threshold
- No extra damage calculated
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Effective Enemy HP = Enemy Max HP × (1 - Culling Threshold)

Example (10% Culling Strike):
- Boss has 10,000,000 HP
- With Culling: You only need to deal 9,000,000 damage
- This is effectively 11.1% MORE damage (10M / 9M = 1.111)

Higher Threshold Example (20% Culling):
- Boss has 10,000,000 HP
- With 20% Culling: You only need 8,000,000 damage
- This is effectively 25% MORE damage (10M / 8M = 1.25)

- 10% threshold = ~11% more effective damage
- 15% threshold = ~17.6% more effective damage
- 20% threshold = 25% more effective damage

            detailed_explanation="""
"Damage Taken As" is a powerful defensive mechanic that converts incoming damage
from one type to another BEFORE your defenses are applied. This allows you to
redirect damage to types you're better at mitigating.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Conversion happens BEFORE mitigation
- Allows redirecting damage to better-defended type
- Stacking rules apply
- Order matters for multiple conversions

COMMON USES:
- "Physical Damage taken as Fire" with high fire resistance
- "Elemental Damage taken as Chaos" with Chaos Inoculation
- "Physical Damage taken as Elemental" to use resistances

HOW IT STACKS:
- Multiple "taken as" effects stack additively up to 100%
- If > 100% of one type, scale proportionally
- Remaining damage stays as original type
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Incoming damage is categorized by type
2. "Taken as" conversions apply BEFORE mitigation
3. Converted damage is then mitigated by its new type's defenses
4. Unconverted damage is mitigated normally

CONVERSION ORDER:
1. Physical → Other (if you have phys taken as X)
2. Elemental → Other (if you have ele taken as X)
3. Apply defenses to final damage types

STACKING EXAMPLE:
- 50% physical taken as fire
- 30% physical taken as cold
- 80% total conversion
- 1000 physical hit becomes:
  - 500 fire damage (mitigated by fire res)
  - 300 cold damage (mitigated by cold res)

- 700 damage becomes fire (mitigated by 75% fire res = 175 taken)
- 300 damage stays physical (mitigated by armor)

With 75% fire resistance and 50% armor reduction:

            detailed_explanation="""
Recoup is a defensive recovery mechanic that heals you for a portion of damage taken
over a period of time (base 4 seconds). Unlike leech which is based on damage DEALT,
recoup is based on damage TAKEN - making it effective regardless of your damage output.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Recovery based on damage TAKEN (not dealt)
- Heals over 4 seconds by default
- Works for Life, Mana, and Energy Shield
- Stacks additively from multiple sources

RECOUP TYPES:
- Life Recoup: Recover X% of damage taken as life over 4 seconds
- Mana Recoup: Recover X% of damage taken as mana over 4 seconds
- ES Recoup: Recover X% of damage taken as energy shield over 4 seconds

WHY RECOUP IS POWERFUL:
- Works regardless of your damage dealt
- Effective for low-DPS builds
- Excellent for ES builds without leech
- Stacks from multiple sources
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. You take damage from any source
2. Recoup calculates: Damage × Recoup%
3. That amount is recovered over 4 seconds (0.25 sec ticks)
4. Multiple damage instances create separate recoup instances
5. All recoup instances stack and heal simultaneously

RECOVERY CALCULATION:
- Total recovery = Damage Taken × Recoup%
- Recovery per second = Total / 4
- Recovery per tick = Total / 16 (every 0.25 sec)

STACKING:
- Multiple recoup sources stack additively
- 10% + 15% + 20% = 45% total recoup
- Each damage instance creates separate recoup

INTERACTION WITH ES:
- ES recoup recovers ES based on damage to ES
- Does NOT bypass recharge delay
- Recoup continues even while taking hits
- Great sustain for ES builds in combat
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Recoup Amount = Damage Taken × Recoup%
Recovery Per Second = Recoup Amount / 4
Recovery Per Tick (0.25s) = Recoup Amount / 16

Example (40% Life Recoup):
- You take 1000 damage
- Recoup: 1000 × 0.40 = 400 life to recover
- Recovery: 100 life per second for 4 seconds
- Or: 25 life every 0.25 seconds

Multiple Hits Example:
- Hit 1: 500 damage → 200 recoup over 4 seconds
- Hit 2 (1 sec later): 300 damage → 120 recoup over 4 seconds
- At second 1-4: Both instances healing simultaneously
- Peak healing at second 1-4 = (200/4) + (120/4) = 80/sec

ES Recoup with 50% ES Recoup:
- 800 damage to ES
- 400 ES recovered over 4 seconds
- Works even while taking more damage (no recharge delay interaction)

On-kill effects are bonuses or actions that trigger when you get a kill. These effects
are common for clearing content but require understanding what counts as "your kill"
versus kills by other sources.

KEY QUESTION: What counts as "your kill"?
- Direct damage kills: YES
- DoT damage kills: YES (your DoT)
- Minion kills: NO (unless specifically stated)
- Totem/trap kills: Usually YES (your skills)
- Ally kills in party: NO

ON-KILL TYPES:
1. Resource gain: Life on kill, mana on kill, ES on kill
2. Charge generation: Frenzy charge on kill, power charge on kill
3. Buff triggers: Onslaught on kill, effects on kill
4. Flask charges: Charge gain on kill

1. An enemy's life reaches 0
2. Game determines who/what caused the killing blow
3. If it was YOUR damage: You get kill credit
4. On-kill effects trigger for the credited killer

KILL CREDIT RULES:
- Your direct damage (attacks, spells): YOUR KILL
- Your damage over time: YOUR KILL
- Your totems using your skills: YOUR KILL (usually)
- Your traps using your skills: YOUR KILL (usually)
- Your minions' damage: MINION'S KILL (not yours)

- Culling Strike: YOUR KILL

MINION KILLS:
- Minion kills are NOT your kills by default
- Some items: "Minions' kills count as your kills"
- With this mod, minion kills trigger YOUR on-kill effects
- Without it, only minion-specific on-kill effects work

DOT KILLS:
- Your ignite/poison/bleed: YOUR KILL
- Ground DoT you created: YOUR KILL
- Enemy DoT on enemy: Not your kill
- DoT from your totem: YOUR KILL (usually)

Increased Item Rarity (IIR) and Increased Item Quantity (IIQ) are two separate
modifiers that affect the loot you receive from killing enemies.

IIR (Increased Item Rarity):
- Increases the CHANCE that dropped items are of higher rarity
- Normal -> Magic -> Rare -> Unique progression
- Does NOT increase the number of items dropped
- Subject to diminishing returns at high values

IIQ (Increased Item Quantity):
- Increases the NUMBER of items that drop
- Does NOT affect the rarity of drops
- Generally more impactful than IIR for currency and base items
- Also subject to diminishing returns

PARTY BONUS:
- Each additional party member adds +50% IIQ (additive)
- 6-player party = +250% IIQ from party bonus alone
- IIR bonus in parties is smaller (roughly +10% per player)
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Enemy is killed
2. Base drop table is rolled (number of items based on enemy type)
3. IIQ multiplier applied to determine actual item count
4. For EACH item dropped:
   - Base rarity roll occurs
   - IIR modifier shifts the rarity threshold
   - Higher IIR = better chance to upgrade rarity tier

DIMINISHING RETURNS:
- First 100% IIR/IIQ gives full value
- Values above 100% have reduced effectiveness
- Formula: Effective = 100 + (Excess x 0.5) roughly
- 200% IIR is approximately 150% effective, not 200%

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
- IIR does NOT affect currency drops (only item rarity)
- IIQ does NOT affect unique drop rates (those are separate)
- Map quantity bonuses are separate multipliers
- Some unique items have fixed drop rates unaffected by IIR/IIQ
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Item Quantity Formula:
Drops = Base_Drops x (1 + IIQ%/100) x (1 + Party_Bonus%/100) x Map_Modifiers

Item Rarity Formula (simplified):
Rarity_Chance = Base_Chance x (1 + Effective_IIR%/100)

Diminishing Returns (approximate):
Effective_IIR = min(IIR, 100) + max(0, (IIR - 100) x 0.5)
Effective_IIQ = min(IIQ, 100) + max(0, (IIQ - 100) x 0.5)

Party Bonus:
Party_IIQ = (Players - 1) x 50%
Party_IIR = (Players - 1) x 10% (approximate)

Example:
- Solo player with 150% IIR, 50% IIQ

"Lucky" and "Unlucky" are modifiers that affect how random rolls are made in PoE2.
These are powerful mechanics that can significantly improve (or worsen) outcomes.

LUCKY:
- The game rolls TWICE and takes the BETTER result
- Applies to the specific stat or check mentioned
- Examples: "Your Critical Strike Chance is Lucky"
- Most impactful when base chance is around 50%

UNLUCKY:
- The game rolls TWICE and takes the WORSE result
- Used as a downside on some powerful effects
- Example: "Evade Chance is Unlucky" from Glancing Blows
- Significantly reduces effective chance

COMMON LUCKY EFFECTS:
- Lucky damage (rolls damage twice, takes higher)
- Lucky critical strikes (rolls crit chance twice)
- Lucky evasion (rolls evade chance twice)
- Lucky ailment application (threshold check twice)
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. A random roll needs to be made (damage, crit chance, etc.)
2. If LUCKY: Roll twice, use the higher value
3. If UNLUCKY: Roll twice, use the lower value

MATHEMATICAL IMPACT:
- For chance-based rolls (0-100%):
  - Lucky: Effective chance = 1 - (1 - BaseChance)^2
  - Unlucky: Effective chance = BaseChance^2
- For range-based rolls (damage):
  - Lucky: Statistically higher average outcome
  - Tends toward upper end of range

EXAMPLES BY BASE CHANCE:
- 10% base chance:
  - Lucky = 19% effective (nearly doubles)
  - Unlucky = 1% effective (drastically reduced)
- 50% base chance:
  - Lucky = 75% effective (50% increase)
  - Unlucky = 25% effective (50% decrease)
- 90% base chance:
  - Lucky = 99% effective (small improvement)
  - Unlucky = 81% effective (small decrease)

KEY INSIGHT: Lucky is most valuable at mid-range chances (~50%).
At very high or very low chances, impact is smaller.

Example (50% crit chance):
- Normal: 50% chance to crit
- Lucky: 1 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 75% effective crit chance

            detailed_explanation="""
"Recently" is a time-based qualifier in Path of Exile 2 that means "within the
past 4 seconds." It's used extensively in conditional modifiers that provide
bonuses based on recent actions.

DURATION: Exactly 4 seconds

COMMON USES:
- "If you've killed recently" - killed an enemy in past 4 seconds
- "If you've been hit recently" - took damage in past 4 seconds
- "If you've used a skill recently" - cast a skill in past 4 seconds
- "If you've blocked recently" - blocked an attack in past 4 seconds

This creates a window-based system where you need to perform certain actions
regularly to maintain the bonuses. Good for active, engaging gameplay.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. You perform an action (kill, hit, block, etc.)
2. A 4-second timer starts for that action type
3. While timer is active, "recently" conditions are TRUE
4. When timer expires, condition becomes FALSE
5. Performing the action again resets the timer

TIMER MECHANICS:
- Timers are action-specific (kill timer, hit timer, etc.)
- Multiple timers can run simultaneously
- Each new action resets its specific timer
- Timers DO NOT stack (just refresh)

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Boss fights: "Recently killed" is hard to maintain without adds
- Mapping: Easy to keep "recently killed" active
- Defensive: "Recently been hit" is usually easy to maintain
- Some builds rely heavily on "recently" bonuses
""",
            calculation_formula="""
"Recently" Duration: 4 seconds (fixed)

Timer States:
- Timer > 0: Condition is TRUE
- Timer = 0: Condition is FALSE

Example Timeline (Kill Recently):
- T=0: Kill enemy -> Timer = 4 seconds
- T=2: Timer = 2 seconds (still "recently killed")
- T=3: Kill another enemy -> Timer = 4 seconds (reset)
- T=7: Timer = 0 (no longer "recently killed")

Multiple "Recently" conditions:
- "If you've killed recently AND been hit recently"
- Both conditions must be true simultaneously
- Each has its own independent 4-second timer

Common Bonuses:
- "20% increased attack speed if you've killed recently"

"In your presence" is a NEW mechanic in PoE2 that refers to an area around your
character where certain effects apply. It functions similarly to "nearby" but is
specifically used for presence-based effects.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Area centered on YOUR character
- Affects allies or enemies "in your presence"
- Similar range to "nearby" (~40 units)
- Used for passive aura-like effects without Spirit cost
- Some effects specifically use "presence" terminology

COMMON USES:
- "Allies in your presence gain..." - Buff nearby allies
- "Enemies in your presence have..." - Debuff nearby enemies
- "While in your presence..." - Conditional effects

This is conceptually similar to auras but:
- Does NOT reserve Spirit
- Cannot be scaled with aura effect (usually)
- Is always active (no skill needed)
- Range is typically fixed

PRESENCE VS AURAS:
- Auras: Reserve Spirit, scale with aura effect, skill-based
- Presence: No reservation, usually fixed effect, passive

PRESENCE VS NEARBY:

            detailed_explanation="""
Projectiles in PoE2 have several behavior modifiers that affect how they interact with
enemies. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for maximizing damage with bow, wand,
and spell-based projectile builds.

KEY BEHAVIORS:
- Pierce: Projectile passes through enemy without stopping
- Chain: Projectile bounces to a new target after hitting
- Fork: Projectile splits into two on hitting an enemy
- Split: Projectile divides into multiple at the moment of firing
- Return: Projectile comes back to you after reaching max distance or final target

IMPORTANT: These behaviors have a priority order. A projectile can only perform ONE
behavior per target hit. The order is: Pierce > Fork > Chain > Return

SHOTGUNNING:
Multiple projectiles from the SAME attack/cast CAN hit the same target in PoE2, but
with restrictions. Projectiles that originate from the same point and travel in the
same direction typically cannot all hit. However, forked/split projectiles or projectiles
with different origins CAN shotgun.
""",
            how_it_works="""
PIERCE:
1. Projectile passes through enemies without being consumed
2. 100% pierce chance = passes through all enemies in path
3. Each enemy can only be hit ONCE per projectile per pass
4. Excellent for clearing dense packs in a line

CHAIN:
1. After hitting, projectile bounces to a new target
2. Chain count determines max bounces (e.g., "Chains +2 Times")
3. Cannot chain back to recently hit targets
4. Range limit on chain distance
5. Each chain reduces damage by default (some sources prevent this)

FORK:
1. On first hit, projectile splits into TWO projectiles
2. Forked projectiles travel at angles from original path
3. Only happens ONCE per original projectile
4. Does not trigger if projectile pierces

SPLIT:
1. At moment of firing, projectile becomes multiple projectiles
2. Example: "Fires 2 additional projectiles"
3. Split projectiles share the same origin point
4. Spread pattern depends on the skill

RETURN:
1. After reaching max range or final target, projectile returns to you
2. Can hit enemies on the return path
3. Some skills have built-in return (Spectral Throw)
4. Return counts as a separate hit opportunity

BEHAVIOR PRIORITY (per hit):
Pierce > Fork > Chain > Return
- If pierce succeeds, fork/chain don't trigger
- If fork triggers, chain doesn't happen
- Return happens at end of projectile life
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Pierce Chance = Sum of all pierce chance sources (capped at 100%)
Chain Count = Sum of all "chains +X" sources
Fork Count = Usually binary (forks or doesn't), some sources add extra forks

Damage per Hit (Chain):
- Default: 30% LESS damage per chain (varies by source)
- Some supports/passives remove the damage penalty
- Hit 1: 100%, Hit 2: 70%, Hit 3: 49%, etc.

Projectile Count (Split/Additional):
Total Projectiles = Base Projectiles + Additional Projectiles
Example: Skill fires 1 base + "2 additional" = 3 projectiles

Shotgunning Conditions:
- Same skill, same cast: Usually NO (travel same path)
- Forked projectiles: YES (different paths)
- Split at target: YES (if mechanics allow)
- Different origin points: YES (Barrage, etc.)

Example Build Calculation:
- Lightning Arrow with Pierce + Fork
- Fires into pack: Pierces first 3 enemies
- On 4th enemy (if pierce fails): Forks into 2 projectiles
- Each fork can hit additional enemies
- Total potential targets: 3 (pierce) + 2x further enemies (forks)

            short_description="AoE radius scaling, overlap mechanics, increased vs more AoE, and breakpoints",
            detailed_explanation="""
Area of Effect (AoE) determines the radius of skills that hit multiple enemies in an
area. Understanding AoE scaling is crucial because the relationship between "increased
area" and actual radius is NOT linear.

KEY CONCEPT:
Area scales with the SQUARE of radius. This means:
- 100% increased area = 41% increased radius (sqrt(2) = 1.41)
- To DOUBLE the radius, you need 300% increased area

This makes AoE investment have diminishing returns for radius but can still be
valuable for covering more screen area.

OVERLAP MECHANICS:
Some skills can "overlap" - hitting the same enemy multiple times with a single use.
Examples include Blade Vortex (multiple blades), Firestorm (multiple impacts), and
certain channeled skills. Overlap is powerful but not all AoE skills can do this.
""",
            how_it_works="""
RADIUS CALCULATION:
1. Base radius defined by skill gem level
2. Apply "increased area of effect" modifiers (additive)
3. Apply "more area of effect" modifiers (multiplicative)
4. Convert area to radius: Radius = BaseRadius x sqrt(TotalAreaMultiplier)

INCREASED vs MORE:
- "Increased Area" sources add together, then apply
- "More Area" multiplies after increased calculation
- Same rules as damage increased/more

AoE BREAKPOINTS:
- PoE2 uses breakpoints for visual representation
- Your actual radius is always the calculated value
- Visual may "snap" to nearest breakpoint
- Mechanical effect uses true calculated radius

OVERLAP RULES:
- Most AoE skills: ONE hit per enemy per use
- Specific skills allow multiple hits: Check skill description
- "Overlapping" usually requires specific mechanics
- Explosions from kills/effects have their own rules

CONCENTRATED EFFECT vs INCREASED AoE:
- These are opposing modifiers
- Concentrated Effect: Less area, MORE damage
- Increased AoE supports: More area, usually no damage penalty
- Cannot use both on same skill (incompatible)
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Total Area Multiplier = (1 + Sum_of_Increased) x More1 x More2 x ...
Radius Multiplier = sqrt(Total Area Multiplier)
Final Radius = Base Radius x Radius Multiplier

Example:
- Base radius: 20 units
- 50% increased area + 30% increased area = 80% increased
- 30% more area
- Area multiplier = 1.80 x 1.30 = 2.34
- Radius multiplier = sqrt(2.34) = 1.53
- Final radius = 20 x 1.53 = 30.6 units

Diminishing Returns Example:
- 0% increased area: radius = 1.00x (baseline)
- 50% increased area: radius = 1.22x
- 100% increased area: radius = 1.41x
- 150% increased area: radius = 1.58x
- 200% increased area: radius = 1.73x

Each additional 50% increased gives less radius than the previous 50%.

Overlap DPS (when applicable):
- If skill overlaps 3 times: Effective DPS = 3 x Base DPS
- Total potential damage increases with overlap count
- Check skill-specific mechanics for overlap behavior

Attack Speed determines how quickly you can perform attack skills. Understanding

- Attack Speed: Modifier that reduces attack time
- Attacks Per Second (APS): How many attacks you perform each second
- Animation Lock: Period during attack where you can't act

DUAL WIELDING:
In PoE2, dual wielding provides a 20% MORE attack speed bonus while attacking.
This is multiplicative and very powerful for dual-wield builds.

ANIMATION CANCELING:
PoE2 has improved animation canceling compared to PoE1. You can cancel attack
animations earlier with movement, though there's still a "point of no return"

BASE ATTACK TIME:
1. Each weapon has a base attack time (e.g., 1.5 seconds)

- 1.0 second attack time = 1.0 APS
- 0.5 second attack time = 2.0 APS
- 0.25 second attack time = 4.0 APS

DUAL WIELD MECHANICS:
1. 20% MORE attack speed while dual wielding (PoE2)
2. Alternates between main hand and off-hand weapons
3. Each hand uses its own weapon stats
4. Total DPS considers both weapons

ANIMATION CANCELING:
1. Attack has wind-up, damage point, and recovery
2. Damage is dealt at the "damage point"
3. Recovery can be canceled by moving/dodging
4. Cannot cancel before damage point (attack won't deal damage)
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Attack Time = Base_Weapon_Time / (1 + Sum_Increased_Speed) / More1 / More2...
APS = 1 / Attack_Time

Example:
- Base weapon time: 1.5 seconds
- 50% + 30% increased attack speed = 80% increased
- 20% more (dual wield)
- Attack Time = 1.5 / 1.80 / 1.20 = 0.694 seconds
- APS = 1 / 0.694 = 1.44 attacks per second

Dual Wield Total DPS:
- Main hand DPS + Off-hand DPS (alternating)
- Total APS applies to combined attacks
- If main = 100 damage, off = 80 damage, 2 APS:
- Effective DPS = (100 + 80) / 2 x 2 = 180 DPS

Local vs Global Attack Speed:
- Local (on weapon): Only affects that weapon's attacks
- Global (passives, gear): Affects all attack skills
- Both stack additively in their categories

Speed Breakpoints:
- Server tick rate affects actual attack execution
- Very high APS may not translate 1:1 to damage
- Generally aim for smooth gameplay feel over max APS

PoE2 has a restructured minion system with two distinct categories:

COMPANIONS:
- Permanent summons that persist until killed
- Limited count (usually 1-3 depending on type)
- High individual power
- Examples: Spectres, Golems, Persistent summons
- Require SPIRIT to maintain (not mana reservation)

MINIONS (Temporary):
- Created by skills, last for a duration or until killed
- Can have many active simultaneously
- Lower individual power but strength in numbers
- Examples: Skeletons, Zombies, temporary summons
- May or may not cost Spirit depending on skill

Minion builds in PoE2 need to manage Spirit budget carefully, as companions
reserve Spirit similar to how auras did in PoE1.
""",
            how_it_works="""
COMPANION MECHANICS:
1. Summoned using a skill, costs Spirit to maintain
2. Limited by companion type (e.g., max 3 Spectres)
3. Stays active until killed or unsummoned
4. If killed, must be re-summoned
5. Benefits from minion scaling passives/gear
6. Has its own life, resists, damage stats

TEMPORARY MINION MECHANICS:
1. Created by skill use, has duration or HP
2. No ongoing Spirit cost (usually)
3. Can summon many rapidly
4. Expires after duration or when killed
5. Strength in numbers - swarm tactics
6. Often has cap on active count

MINION SCALING:
- "Minion damage" applies to all minion types
- "Minion life" increases their survivability
- "Minion attack/cast speed" for faster actions
- "Minion resistance" for elemental survival
- YOUR offensive stats do NOT apply to minions

AGGRO AND AI:
1. Minions target what you target (if in range)
2. Will attack nearby enemies automatically
3. Aggressive AI - seek out enemies
4. Can be directed with Convocation skill
5. Some skills allow more control over targeting

MINION DAMAGE CONVERSION:
- Minions use THEIR damage types
- Your conversion doesn't affect them
- Specific minion gems can add conversion
- Minion damage scales their base damage

Auras are persistent area effects that provide buffs to you and allies or debuffs to
enemies. In PoE2, auras have been split into different reservation systems:

SPIRIT-BASED AURAS:
- Traditional "always-on" auras reserve Spirit
- Examples: Determination, Hatred, Wrath, etc.
- Limited by your total Spirit pool
- Provide powerful persistent buffs

PRESENCE EFFECTS:
- Some buffs are "Presence" effects in PoE2
- Work differently from traditional auras
- May have different reservation or activation mechanics

MANA RESERVATION:
- Some effects still reserve mana (not Spirit)
- Heralds and certain skills use mana reservation
- Separate pool from Spirit-based auras

This split allows more build flexibility - you can run Spirit auras AND
mana-reserving effects simultaneously.
""",
            how_it_works="""
SPIRIT AURA ACTIVATION:
1. Activate aura skill
2. Spirit is reserved (fixed amount, not percentage)
3. Aura remains active until deactivated or death
4. Provides buff to you and allies in radius
5. Deactivating immediately frees Spirit

AURA RADIUS:
1. Each aura has a base radius
2. "Increased aura effect" improves the buff
3. "Increased aura area of effect" improves radius
4. Allies must be in radius to benefit

AURA STACKING:
1. Same aura from multiple sources: Usually doesn't stack (best applies)
2. Different auras: All apply simultaneously
3. Your auras + party member auras: Both can apply
4. "Aura effect" modifiers improve your aura's strength

ALLY vs ENEMY AURAS:
1. Buff auras: Affect you and allies
2. Debuff auras: Affect enemies in radius
3. Some auras have both ally buff AND enemy debuff components
4. Examples: Malediction (enemy debuff), Discipline (ally buff)

RESERVATION EFFICIENCY:
- Some passives reduce reservation costs
- "X% reduced mana/spirit reservation" helps
- Allows fitting more auras in your budget

Fortify is a defensive buff that reduces incoming damage. In PoE2, Fortify uses a
STACK system where you build up stacks through specific actions, and each stack
provides damage reduction.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Stacking buff (not binary on/off)
- Each stack provides % damage reduction
- Stacks have duration and decay over time
- Generated through melee hits and specific skills
- Capped at maximum stacks (usually 20)

Fortify is primarily associated with melee builds due to its generation methods,
providing a significant defensive layer for characters in close combat.
""",
            how_it_works="""
STACK GENERATION:
1. Melee hits grant Fortify stacks (based on damage dealt)
2. Some skills grant stacks directly
3. Passives can provide easier generation
4. Each stack has its own duration

STACK DECAY:
1. Stacks decay over time (oldest first)
2. Base duration: 5 seconds per stack
3. Can refresh stacks by continuing to generate
4. Duration modifiers affect how long stacks last

DAMAGE REDUCTION:
1. Each stack provides 1% damage reduction
2. Maximum stacks cap the total reduction
3. Typical cap: 20 stacks = 20% damage reduction
4. Applies to ALL incoming damage types

GENERATION THRESHOLDS:
1. Melee hits must deal significant damage
2. Low damage hits may not grant stacks
3. This prevents easy generation with fast, weak hits
4. Encourages hard-hitting melee playstyles
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Damage Reduction = Current_Stacks x 1%
Capped at: Max_Stacks x 1% (typically 20%)

Example:
- 15 Fortify stacks active
- Damage reduction = 15 x 1% = 15% reduced damage taken
- Incoming 1000 damage: 1000 x 0.85 = 850 damage taken

Stack Duration:
Duration = 5 seconds base x (1 + Duration_Modifiers)
With 50% increased duration: 5 x 1.5 = 7.5 seconds per stack

Generation from Melee:
Stacks Gained = Function of (Damage Dealt / Enemy Life)
- Big hits on weak enemies: More stacks
- Small hits: May grant no stacks
- Exact formula varies by skill/source

Rage is a resource/buff that builds up during combat and provides offensive bonuses.
It's primarily associated with Marauder/Berserker builds but accessible to any build
that invests in it.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Generated by hitting enemies (attacks)
- Each point of Rage provides damage and speed bonuses
- Decays over time when not generating
- Maximum Rage is typically 50 (can be increased)
- Berserk skill consumes Rage for powerful buff

Rage encourages aggressive playstyles - keep attacking to maintain your buff,
stop attacking and your power fades.
""",
            how_it_works="""
RAGE GENERATION:
1. Hit enemies with attacks to generate Rage
2. Base generation: Variable depending on source
3. Some skills/passives improve generation rate
4. Cannot generate while at maximum Rage
5. Generation requires HITTING, not just attacking

RAGE DECAY:
1. Rage decays when you stop generating
2. Decay starts after brief grace period (~4 seconds)
3. Lose ~1-2 Rage per second during decay
4. Continuous attacking prevents decay
5. Some sources slow decay rate

RAGE BONUSES (per point):
- Increased Attack Damage
- Increased Attack Speed
- Increased Movement Speed
- Exact values depend on source/build

BERSERK SKILL:
1. Activated ability that consumes Rage
2. Provides powerful MORE damage and speed
3. Effect scales with Rage consumed
4. Duration depends on Rage consumed
5. Popular for boss burst damage phases

MAXIMUM RAGE:
- Base maximum: 50 Rage
- Can be increased through passives/items
- Higher max = higher sustained bonuses
- Higher max = longer Berserk duration
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Rage Bonuses (typical values per point):
- 1% increased Attack Damage per Rage
- 1% increased Attack Speed per Rage (from some sources)
- 1% increased Movement Speed per Rage (from some sources)

Example at 50 Rage:
- Attack Damage: 50% increased
- Attack Speed: Variable (depends on sources)
- Movement Speed: Variable (depends on sources)

Berserk Calculation:
- Consumes all Rage when activated
- Duration = Base Duration + (Rage x 0.1 seconds) approximately
- Effect scales: More Rage consumed = stronger effect

Rage Decay:
- Grace period: ~4 seconds of no generation
- Decay rate: ~1-2 Rage per second
- 50 Rage to 0: ~25-50 seconds without generation

Total DPS with Rage:
DPS_with_Rage = Base_DPS x (1 + Rage x Damage_Per_Rage/100)

Life Regeneration is passive healing that occurs continuously, recovering your life
without requiring any action. Understanding regen mechanics is important for sustain
builds, especially Righteous Fire and other degen-based playstyles.

KEY TYPES:
- Flat Regeneration: Regenerate X life per second (fixed value)
- Percent Regeneration: Regenerate X% of maximum life per second
- Both stack together for total regeneration

REGENERATION RATE:
"Regeneration Rate" is a MODIFIER that increases how effective your regen is.
It's multiplicative with your base regeneration, making it very powerful.

This is different from "increased life regeneration" which is additive.
""",
            how_it_works="""
FLAT REGENERATION:
1. Fixed amount of life per second
2. Example: "Regenerate 50 life per second"
3. Does not scale with max life
4. Good early game, falls off with high life pools

PERCENT REGENERATION:
1. Percentage of your maximum life per second
2. Example: "Regenerate 2% of maximum life per second"
3. Scales automatically as you get more life
4. Primary source of regen for most builds

REGENERATION RATE MODIFIER:
1. "X% increased Life Regeneration Rate"
2. MULTIPLIES your total regeneration
3. 50% increased rate = 1.5x your regen
4. Very powerful scaling option

INTERACTION WITH DEGENS:
1. Regeneration offsets degeneration damage
2. Net effect = Regen - Degen per second
3. If Regen > Degen: You heal
4. If Degen > Regen: You take net damage
5. Righteous Fire: Classic example of regen vs degen balance

REGENERATION STACKING:
- All flat regen sources add together
- All % regen sources add together
- Then Rate modifiers multiply the total
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Total Regeneration:
Base_Flat = Sum of all flat regen sources
Base_Percent = Sum of all % regen sources
Percent_Regen = Max_Life x (Base_Percent / 100)
Total_Base_Regen = Base_Flat + Percent_Regen
Final_Regen = Total_Base_Regen x (1 + Regen_Rate_Increased/100)

Example:
- Max Life: 5000
- Flat regen: 100/sec
- % regen: 3% + 2% = 5%
- Regen rate: 50% increased

Calculation:
- Percent regen: 5000 x 0.05 = 250/sec
- Total base: 100 + 250 = 350/sec
- With rate: 350 x 1.5 = 525/sec final

Righteous Fire Balance:
RF_Degen = 90% of max life as fire damage per second (reduced by fire res)
Needed_Regen = RF_Degen_After_Resist to sustain
Example: 90% of 5000 = 4500/sec, with 80% fire res = 900/sec degen
Need 900+ life regen per second to sustain RF

            detailed_explanation="""
Accuracy is the stat that determines whether your attacks hit enemies. In PoE2,
accuracy is checked against the target's evasion rating to determine hit chance.

The formula is: Hit Chance = Accuracy / (Accuracy + Evasion/4)

This means you need roughly 4x the enemy's evasion in accuracy to achieve ~80% hit chance.
Hit chance is capped between 5% (minimum) and 100% (maximum).

IMPORTANT: Spells do NOT use accuracy - they always hit (unless the enemy has
specific spell avoidance). Only attacks use accuracy.

Resolute Technique is a keystone that makes your hits always hit but you can
never deal critical strikes.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. When you attack, the game calculates your hit chance
2. Formula: Hit Chance = Accuracy / (Accuracy + Evasion/4)

5. If the roll fails, the attack misses completely (no damage, no effects)
6. Spells ALWAYS hit - accuracy only affects attacks
7. Resolute Technique: Hits can't be evaded, but can't crit either

ACCURACY SOURCES:
- Base accuracy from level (increases per level)

Mana is your primary resource for using most active skills. Every skill has a mana
cost that must be paid when using it. If you don't have enough mana, you can't use
the skill.

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Mana Cost: Flat amount deducted when using a skill
- Mana Reservation: Permanent reduction to max mana (percentage or flat)
- Mana Regeneration: Natural recovery over time
- Mana Recovery Rate: Multiplier affecting all mana recovery
- "Full Mana" Conditions: Some effects trigger when mana is full

In PoE2, Spirit handles most auras/heralds (not mana reservation), but some skills
still reserve mana. Mana management is crucial for sustained combat.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Skills have base mana costs (modified by supports, passives, gear)
2. Using a skill deducts the cost from current mana
3. If current mana < cost, skill cannot be used
4. Mana regenerates naturally based on your regen rate
5. Mana can also be recovered through leech, flasks, and on-hit effects
6. Some skills reserve a portion of your max mana (reduces available pool)

MANA RESERVATION:
- Flat reservation: Reserves exact amount (e.g., -50 mana)
- Percentage reservation: Reserves % of max (e.g., 25% of max mana)
- Reservation efficiency modifiers reduce the amount reserved
- Reserved mana cannot be spent - it's locked

MANA REGENERATION:
- Base regen: ~1.75% of max mana per second
- Increased by %mana regeneration rate modifiers
- Affected by Mana Recovery Rate (multiplier)

"FULL MANA" MECHANICS:
- Some passives/items trigger effects when at full mana
- Requires current mana = unreserved max mana
- Can be maintained with high regen or low-cost skills
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Available Mana = Maximum Mana - Reserved Mana

Mana Regeneration per second = Max Mana x Base Regen% x (1 + increased regen%) x Recovery Rate

Example:
- Max Mana: 500
- 25% reservation (aura): 125 reserved
- Available: 375 mana
- Base regen 1.75%: 500 x 0.0175 = 8.75 mana/sec base
- +100% increased regen: 8.75 x 2.0 = 17.5 mana/sec
- 50% increased recovery rate: 17.5 x 1.5 = 26.25 mana/sec

Mana Cost Calculation:
Final Cost = Base Cost x (1 + sum of cost modifiers) x cost multipliers
- "Reduced mana cost" = additive reduction
- "Less mana cost" = multiplicative reduction (rarer, more powerful)

Cooldowns are timers that prevent skills from being used again until they expire.
Many powerful skills in PoE2 have cooldowns to balance their strength.

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Cooldown Time: Base time before skill can be used again
- Cooldown Recovery Rate: Multiplier that speeds up cooldown expiration
- Cooldown Bypass: Ways to ignore or skip cooldowns (charges, triggers)
- Minimum Cooldown: Some effects have a floor that can't be reduced below

Understanding cooldowns is essential for optimizing skill rotations and
maximizing uptime on powerful abilities.
""",

1. Use a skill with a cooldown
2. Cooldown timer starts (skill unusable)
3. Timer counts down based on cooldown recovery rate
4. When timer reaches 0, skill is usable again
5. Some skills store multiple charges (each with own cooldown)
6. Some effects bypass cooldowns entirely

COOLDOWN RECOVERY RATE:
- Base recovery rate is 100% (1 second = 1 second)
- +50% cooldown recovery rate: 1 second base = 0.67s actual
- Formula: Actual Cooldown = Base Cooldown / (1 + increased recovery rate)

COOLDOWN CHARGES:
- Skills can have multiple uses stored
- Each use consumes a charge
- Charges regenerate independently
- Can use skill while other charges are cooling down

COOLDOWN BYPASS:
- Some effects grant 'cooldown bypass' (skill usable regardless)
- Triggered skills may ignore cooldown
- Specific mechanics like Second Wind support

MINIMUM COOLDOWN:
- Some effects have a floor (e.g., 0.25 seconds minimum)
- Cannot be reduced below minimum regardless of recovery rate
- Check skill description for minimum cooldown

Damage conversion changes damage from one type to another BEFORE it hits the enemy.
This is extremely powerful because converted damage benefits from modifiers to BOTH
the original type AND the final type.

Physical -> Lightning -> Cold -> Fire -> Chaos

You can ONLY convert forward in this chain. You cannot convert Fire back to Cold,
or Chaos to anything else.

CONVERSION CHAIN:
Physical -> Lightning -> Cold -> Fire -> Chaos
- Can skip steps (Physical -> Fire directly is valid)
- Cannot go backwards (Fire -> Cold is impossible)
- Chaos is the end - cannot convert chaos to anything

OVER 100% CONVERSION:
- If total conversion exceeds 100%, it's normalized
- Example: 60% Phys to Fire + 60% Phys to Cold = 120% total
- Normalized: 60/120 = 50% each, so 50% Fire + 50% Cold

"ADDED AS" VS CONVERSION:
- Conversion: Changes damage type (doesn't increase total base)
- "Added as": Creates EXTRA damage of another type
- Example: "Gain 20% of Physical as Extra Fire"
  - 100 physical stays 100 physical
  - PLUS 20 extra fire damage = 120 total

DOUBLE-DIPPING (how it benefits you):
- 100 physical damage, 50% increased physical, 50% increased fire
- Convert 100% physical to fire
- Physical bonus applies first: 100 x 1.5 = 150
- Fire bonus applies to converted: 150 x 1.5 = 225 final fire damage
- Without conversion, only physical bonus = 150 damage

CONVERSION ORDER:
1. Base damage of original type
2. Apply "added as extra" (creates additional damage)
3. Apply conversion (changes damage type, normalized if >100%)
4. Apply damage modifiers to each damage type

Example - Full Physical to Fire conversion:
- 100 base physical damage
- 50% increased physical damage
- 50% increased fire damage
- 100% physical converted to fire

Step 1: Physical damage = 100 x (1 + 0.5) = 150 (from phys bonus)
Step 2: Converted to fire = 150 fire damage
Step 3: Fire bonus applies = 150 x (1 + 0.5) = 225 final fire damage

- Cold: 50/120 = 41.7% of physical -> cold
- 100 physical = 58.3 lightning + 41.7 cold

            detailed_explanation="""
Resistances reduce incoming damage of their respective types. They are your PRIMARY
defense against elemental and chaos damage in Path of Exile 2.

RESISTANCE TYPES:
- Fire Resistance: Reduces fire damage
- Cold Resistance: Reduces cold damage
- Lightning Resistance: Reduces lightning damage
- Chaos Resistance: Reduces chaos damage

CAPS:
- Default cap: 75% (you take 25% of incoming damage)
- Maximum possible cap: 90% (hard cap, cannot exceed)
- Sources can raise cap (e.g., +1% to maximum fire resistance)

NEGATIVE RESISTANCE:
- Resistances CAN go negative
- Negative resistance means you take MORE damage
- -50% fire res = you take 150% fire damage!
- Campaign penalty: -30% to all elemental res after Act 5 equivalent
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Incoming damage of a type is checked against your resistance
2. Damage Taken = Incoming Damage x (1 - Resistance%)
3. Resistance is capped at your maximum (default 75%)
4. Can go negative (acts as damage amplification)

RESISTANCE PENALTY:
- After certain story progression, you get -30% to elemental resistances
- This is permanent and must be overcome with gear/passives
- Chaos resistance has no penalty (but also fewer sources)

OVERCAPPING:
- Getting resistance ABOVE your cap (e.g., 120% fire res with 75% cap)
- Excess doesn't reduce damage further
- BUT protects against resistance reduction effects (curses, exposure)
- Recommended: 10-20% overcap for endgame

MAXIMUM RESISTANCE:
- Default maximum is 75% for all types
- Can be increased by specific sources (passives, gear, auras)
- Hard cap of 90% - cannot exceed regardless of modifiers
- Each 1% above 75% is very valuable (4% less damage taken per point)
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Damage Taken = Incoming Damage x (1 - Resistance / 100)
Resistance = min(Your Resistance, Your Maximum Resistance)

Example - Normal resistance:
- 1000 fire damage incoming
- 75% fire resistance (capped)
- Damage taken = 1000 x (1 - 0.75) = 250 damage

Example - Negative resistance:
- 1000 fire damage incoming
- -30% fire resistance (uncapped campaign)
- Damage taken = 1000 x (1 - (-0.30)) = 1000 x 1.30 = 1300 damage!

Example - Overcapping:
- You have 105% fire resistance, 75% cap
- Elemental Weakness curse: -30% resistance
- After curse: 105% - 30% = 75% (still capped!)
- Without overcap: 75% - 30% = 45% (significant damage increase)

Maximum Resistance Value:
- At 75% res: Take 25% damage
- At 80% res: Take 20% damage (20% less than at 75%!)
- At 85% res: Take 15% damage (40% less than at 75%!)
- At 90% res: Take 10% damage (60% less than at 75%!)

        # =====================================================================

            name="Ailment Threshold",
            category=MechanicCategory.AILMENTS,
            short_description="NEW in PoE2 - Ailments require damage threshold, no longer guaranteed on crit",
            detailed_explanation="""
Ailment Threshold is a NEW mechanic in PoE2 that fundamentally changes how ailments
are applied. Unlike PoE1 where critical strikes guaranteed ailments, PoE2 uses a
damage-based threshold system.

CORE CONCEPT:
- Enemies have an Ailment Threshold (usually equal to their max life)
- Your chance to apply an ailment depends on damage dealt vs their threshold
- Bigger hits = higher chance to apply ailments
- Crits help by dealing more damage, but do NOT guarantee ailments

This system makes ailment application more consistent with build investment
while preventing trivial ailment spam with any build.

BUILDUP AILMENTS (Freeze, Electrocute):
- These use a buildup bar instead of instant application
- Multiple hits accumulate buildup
- When buildup reaches 100%, ailment triggers
- Buildup decays over time
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. You hit an enemy with damage that can cause an ailment
2. Game calculates: (Your Damage / Enemy Ailment Threshold) x Base Chance
3. Higher ratio = higher chance to apply
4. For buildup ailments, damage adds to a buildup bar

INSTANT AILMENTS (Ignite, Shock, Poison, Bleed):
- Chance = Base Ailment Chance x (Damage / Threshold)
- Example: 25% base ignite chance, deal 50% of threshold = 12.5% ignite chance
- Deal 100% of threshold in one hit = 25% ignite chance
- Deal 200% of threshold = 50% ignite chance (if you have enough base chance)

BUILDUP AILMENTS (Freeze, Electrocute):
- Each hit adds to a buildup bar
- Buildup amount based on damage vs threshold
- At 100% buildup, ailment triggers
- Buildup decays over time (roughly 10-15% per second)
- Boss thresholds increase after each application (anti-perma-CC)

AILMENT THRESHOLD VALUE:
- For most enemies: Threshold = Maximum Life
- Bosses may have higher thresholds
- Some enemies have ailment immunity or high thresholds
""",
            calculation_formula="""
INSTANT AILMENT CHANCE:
Chance = Base Chance x (Damage Dealt / Ailment Threshold)

Example (Ignite with 25% base chance):
- Enemy threshold: 10,000 (their max life)
- You deal 5,000 fire damage
- Ignite chance = 25% x (5000 / 10000) = 12.5%

Example (higher damage):
- Same enemy, 10,000 fire damage
- Ignite chance = 25% x (10000 / 10000) = 25%

BUILDUP AILMENTS:
Buildup Added = (Damage / Threshold) x Buildup Modifier
At 100% Buildup = Ailment Triggers

Example (Freeze):
- Enemy threshold: 10,000
- Hit 1: 3,000 cold damage = ~30% buildup
- Hit 2: 3,000 cold damage = ~60% total
- Hit 3: 3,000 cold damage = ~90% total
- Buildup decays between hits!
- Hit 4 (fast enough): 100%+ = FROZEN

BOSS THRESHOLDS:
- First freeze: Normal threshold
- Second freeze: Threshold increased
- Each subsequent: Higher and higher
- Decays over time (maybe 30-60 seconds)

Dodge Roll is a NEW active defense mechanic in PoE2 that gives players direct control
over damage avoidance. By dodge rolling, you gain brief invincibility frames (i-frames)
that let you pass through attacks unharmed.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Costs stamina to perform
- Grants invincibility during the roll animation
- Covers a short distance in the roll direction
- Some attacks CANNOT be dodge rolled (specific boss mechanics)
- Essential skill for surviving in PoE2

This is fundamentally different from PoE1 where "dodge" was a passive stat. In PoE2,
dodge roll is an active ability that rewards player skill.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. Press dodge roll key/button (spacebar by default)
2. Stamina is consumed
3. Character performs a quick roll in movement direction
4. During roll animation, you have INVINCIBILITY FRAMES
5. Attacks that hit during i-frames deal NO damage
6. After roll, brief recovery before you can act/roll again

STAMINA SYSTEM:
- You have a stamina bar (like a separate resource)
- Dodge rolling costs stamina
- Stamina regenerates over time
- Running also consumes stamina
- Cannot dodge roll without sufficient stamina

I-FRAMES (INVINCIBILITY FRAMES):
- Brief window during roll where you're invulnerable
- Timing matters - roll INTO attacks for best effect
- Some attacks have long hitbox durations (harder to i-frame)
- Learning enemy attack timings is crucial

LIMITATIONS:
- Some boss attacks CANNOT be dodged (often telegraphed)
- Ground effects persist (rolling through fire still burns after)
- Stamina depletion leaves you vulnerable
- Short range - cannot use as primary movement
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Dodge Roll Mechanics:
- Base Stamina Cost: ~30% of stamina bar (varies by build)
- Base Stamina Regen: Recovers over ~3-4 seconds
- Roll Distance: Short (about 1-2 character lengths)
- I-Frame Duration: Brief window during animation (~0.3-0.5 seconds)

Stamina Management:
- Full stamina bar = 2-3 consecutive rolls
- Running depletes stamina slowly
- Standing still regenerates stamina quickly
- Some passives/gear affect stamina

Cannot Dodge:
- Boss "ground slam" indicators (red zones)
- Some grab attacks
- Persistent ground effects (damage after roll ends)
- Specifically marked "undodgeable" attacks

Example Timing:
- Boss winds up attack (1 second)
- Attack hitbox active (0.5 seconds)
- You roll DURING the 0.5 second window
- Your i-frames overlap the hitbox = no damage
